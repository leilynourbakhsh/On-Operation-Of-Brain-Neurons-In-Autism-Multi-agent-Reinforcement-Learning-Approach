My BS. Thesis: On Operation Of Brain Neurons In Autism: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach
Autism is one of the Neuropsychiatric diseases that occurs due to improper performance of the prefrontal cortex neurons. No definitive cure for this
disease has been discovered yet. Today, due to the vast power of artificial intelligence (AI) in the prevention and diagnosis of diseases, experts have paid
attention to the use of AI methods to enhance the operation of brain neurons for this disease. In this project, we introduce two novel approaches to
evaluate the function of brain neurons in Autism Spectrum Disorder. We will answer the fundamental questions of whether there is any hope to train
brain neurons in the brain network for an autism person. In fact, if the brain neurons are being trained, will they perform better?
We used a special package, Brain2, to simulate
neurons in the neural network and analyze their
behavior accurately.
